# Tribute Page Assignment

## Subject

I chose Team OG as the subject for my tribute page assignment as I am a big fan of esports, more specifically, Dota 2. I have been watching their progress since 2018 and they have won me over not only through their unbelievable gaming style but also through their team culture.

## Project Notes

* I started this project by designing the desktop page. In hindsight, I should have started with a mobile-first approach, however, I noticed that I find it a bit 'unnatural' to design the mobile version first. I find it harder to come up with a mobile design as I do not have a lot of experience with mobile UI.

* I tried to keep the design as simple and as clean as possible but I couldn't help myself and I added some keyframe css animations for the logo and the header h1.

* It's important to note that I did not write the content of the page myself. I collated bits of information from various sources and I pasted them into the *li* elements.

* Although I tried to embed youtube videos without the titles, it seems that we are no longer able to remove the title from the iframe as that feature was deprecated.
