                <p>OG are the most popular European Dota 2 team out there. The team gained its popularity after making one of the finest Cinderella stories in the history of Esports. A newly-formed squad that managed to win against all odds and take The International trophy.</p>

                <h3>Progress</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tired of being tossed from team to team and never achieving anything, players <strong>Johan "N0tail" Sundstein</strong> and <strong>Tal “Fly” Aizik</strong> founded Team OG in 2015. The first roster was comprised of N0tail, Fly, <strong>Amir "Miracle-" Al-Barkawi</strong>, <strong>Andreas Franck "Cr1t-" Nielsen</strong>, and <strong>David "MoonMeander" Tan</strong>.</li>
                    <li>In their first season, OG already achieved what other teams could only dream about. They won the Frankfurt Major 2015 by defeating Team Secret 3:1, and they were first in DreamLeague Season 4.</li>
                    <li>At <strong>The International 2016</strong>, OG dominated during the group stage and they finished first in the group with Evil Geniuses, Wings Gaming, and Alliance. However, in the main event, they lost against MVP Phoenix in the upper bracket. The lower bracket wasn’t so kind to them either and they lost against TNC Pro Team.</li>
                    <li>After those 2 loses, they were knocked out of the tournament ending up at the 9-12th spot. It put them on the map but it wasn’t even close to their expectations. They weren’t satisfied with that result and some roster changes had to be made.</li>
                    <li>MoonMeander was removed, and Cr1t- and Miracle- left the team. They were replaced by <strong>Gustav "s4" Magnusson</strong> (former Alliance player), <strong>Jesse "Jerax" Vainikka</strong> (former Team Liquid player), and <strong>Anathan "ana" Pham</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>The International 2017</strong> wasn’t any better. Their bad performance during the group stage barely got them to the lower bracket. In the end, LGD Gaming knocked them out in the third round, making them finish 7-8th. It wasn’t such a bad result but they knew they could do better.</li>
                    <li>N0tail and Fly, the founders of this team, had been friends for 9 years. They played almost 1500 matches together, more than any other duo ever in Dota 2 history. However, after the loss at the ESL One Birmingham 2018, Fly broke the promise on which the team was created and unexpectedly left without any notice. He also took s4 with him and they went to play for Evil Geniuses, the best team from the NA region.</li>
                    <li>The incident happened only a few hours before the China Dota 2 Super Major which was also the last major of the season. Team OG had to withdraw from that tournament because they were 2 players short.</li>
                    <li>Just before the open qualifiers for <strong>The International 2018</strong>, OG announced that ana was returning to the roster along with <strong>Topias Miikka "Topson" Taavitsainen</strong> who was not that well known at the time.</li>
                    <li>TI8 was the first International where OG didn’t stand a chance to win. The team was falling apart and they were a complete underdog. A new roster composed of new players with no trust and chemistry between them. Everything fell apart but they never gave up.</li>
                    <li>The second match was against their rival Evil Geniuses. Of course, Team OG had a lot of bad blood with them because Fly and s4, who had abandoned them just before the last Major, were playing there. OG wanted revenge. As the underdog, they managed to win that match, get square with their rivals, and close that chapter.</li>
                    <li>They made it to the final eventually and were crowned as the champions of The International 2018. A fairytale ending for the ones who never gave up.</li>
                    <li>Team OG is the first team to be crowned the champions of The International for two consecutive tournaments. In 2019 they won <strong>The International 2019</strong> in a final against Team Liquid.</li>
